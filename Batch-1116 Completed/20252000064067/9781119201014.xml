<ce:para>Praise for surviving the bond bear market "a confluence of events are converging to produce a rise in bond yields and a decline in bond prices. Authors Cohen and Malburg call the emerging bear market in bonds . . . 'Bondland's Nuclear Winter.' I call shorting bonds . . . 'The Trade of the Decade.' But whatever it is called, this book articulates the root cause of the developing crisis by taking you through a journey of strong analysis, great anecdotes, and visual stories."—Doug Kass, founder and President, Seabreeze Partners Management "Baby Boomers beware—the thirty-year bond bull market is finished. Marilyn Cohen describes the bond market's coming nuclear winter and what investors must do to protect themselves. This book comes with an automated workbook to help you manage your bond investments like the pros. Learn to build a bond market bomb shelter and pick the green shoots when it is safe to come out again. Cohen prepares you for the worst, even as she hopes for the best."—Jane Bryant Quinn, author of Making the Most of Your Money Now</ce:para>
